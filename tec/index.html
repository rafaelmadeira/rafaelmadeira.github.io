          <div class="structure-paragraph">
            <h3>Overly complicated</h3>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              In 2019, Tec Concursos was an EdTech startup with a good reputation and a bad image.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              They'd developed an exclusive data-based methodology that helped students prepare for civil service entrance examinations, and built an innovative product to bring it to thousands of users.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              As more and more users got admitted into their dream civil service positions, Tec became highly regarded for its impressive results. It also became widely regarded as overly complicated. It was a powerful tool that could change your life &mdash; if only you could figure out how to use it.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              As a result, userbase growth began to suffer.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              I was brought in to help change that perception and turn that trend around.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="process section-content">
        <div class="text-content">
          <div class="structure-heading">
            <h2 class="text-heading">The Process</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="structure-paragraph">
            <h3>Connecting the dots</h3>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              We defined user base growth as our end goal. I ran a full usability audit and heard from users past and current about their frustrations and desires. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              We knew we had to make everything simpler and easier, but how exactly would that translate into more signups?
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              Causal analysis showed that this would only work if our interventions resulted in users becoming more confident in their performance, and specially in more people actually passing exams. Improving user performance and performance awareness then became the main focus of our work.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              We did this by introducing better onboarding to help familiarize the user with what the platform offered, and a dashboard where they could assess their performance and evolution. This allowed users to have greater confidence on Tec even before passing their exams.
            </p>
            <h3>Performance at every turn</h3>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              In addition, to learn effectively, users need all the brainpower they can get. For this, reducing cognitive load throughout the user experience was paramount.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              I developed a design system light on chrome and worked with users and stakeholders to make flows intuitive and efficient.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              <img src="../img/tec-chromeless.png" alt="A chromeless interface">
            </p>
            <h3>High-tech and human</h3>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              As the name suggests, Tec branded itself as a high-tech tool. This was its strength, and it was a unique proposition in the market. However, this proved to be a double-edged sword, as many found it intimidating. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              <img src="../img/afraid-of-technology.gif" alt="Afraid of technology">
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              We didn't want to lose the high-tech edge, so we balanced it with a humanized brand:
            </p>
            <p>
              <ul class="text-paragraph">
                <li>
                  A vibrant color palette for the brand and appropriate counterparts for the UI.
                </li>
                <li>
                   A new logo featuring a hand-drawn symbol along with a lowercase, rounded wordmark.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Liberal use of humanistic elements on the website, ads, and social media, such as illustrations, animations, photographs and quotes of real teachers, users, and staff.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              <img src="../img/tec-humanistic.png" alt="Interface with vibrant colors and real user pictures">
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              For example, for the features page, I used testimonials from users who had already passed their exams, making it easier for prospective users to  connect the features to their real-world value.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              <img src="../img/tec-testimonials.png" alt="The value of features in the user's own words">
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              Communicating the value of features in the users' own words also allowed us to draw attention to things that would sound conceited if we'd said it ourselves ðŸ™‚.
            </p>
            <h3>No one wants a redesign</h3>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              Our last major concern was that this was already a community of thousands and, even though users had many suggestions and complaints, no one wants a redesign. We want things to be just as they are, only better.
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              So if we didn't conduct this carefully, we could have a very costly revolt on our hands. There were other big players in that space and switching costs were not high. One disappointing change and the shop across the street would start to look a lot more appealing.
            </p>

            <h3>How we did it</h3>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              We decided on 4 measures to increase our odds of success:
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              <ol class="text-paragraph">
                <li>
                  Change would be incremental. The complete transformation, including not only the redesign but the planned new features, took place over the course of about 2 years.
                </li>
                <li>
                  As often as possible, change would come in the form of, or accompanied by, fixing known bugs and addressing common complaints. This meant they would often be received with some level of built-in approval.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We kept the "old version" around for those who preferred it. We wanted users to want to make the switch instead of feeling like they had to.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We made a point to listen to users every step of the way.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <h2 class="text-heading">The Results</h2>
          </div>
          <div class="structure-paragraph">

            <h3>Good things went up, bad things went down</h3>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              This is how some key metrics changed:
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              <ul class="text-paragraph">
                <li>
                  User activity increased.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Feature adoption increased.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Product abandonment decreased.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Customer success increased, meaning more users were passing their exams.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Brand evangelism increased.
                </li>
                <li>
                  User base increased, going into the tens of thousands.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              And, ultimately, we were able to undo the general perception that the platform was complicated even as it became objectively more complex. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-paragraph">
              Today, Tec is known for being powerful <em>and</em> easy to use.
